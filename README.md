# CalCool

CalCool application is designed and written for the purpose of being a supplementary math resource, targeting high school students. This is a little project of mine that I worked on about 2 years ago when I was a junior in high school. I never really got to finish the app but decided to put this up on Github so in a few years I can look back and laugh at myself and this little silly program.

It is written in Python and uses Tkinter as the GUI.

The App houses 2 main feature: one focuses on explaining a math concept, another being an interactive Playground where users can learn by experimenting and interacting with the app (trivia games, interactive graphs, etc)

It is still in beta stage and may contain bugs and errors; Pmw and PIL modules for Python are required to be installed on the computer on which this script is run.

As of now, the only topic that is supplied and tested is Trigonometry.

**We do not own any of the images used.**

Launching page of the app. Nothing much--just some cheesy tagline.

Users would choose topics to learn from from this page.

And go through the lessons.

Then they can go to the Playground where they can practice doing exercises and get hints.




# iOS Logo & Prototype

About 3 months after I finished the first version of this app, Swift had just been released and gaining more popularity. So I decided that I'd be fun try making a prototype iOS-version of this app, as well as a logo. I didn't get far with the Xcode storyboard, but I did make an icon. So here it is, a priceless CalCool iOS icon that has never been used. Who knows I might get to revisit this project sometime in the future.
